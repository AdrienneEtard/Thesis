\caption[Framework of the study]{\textbf{Framework of the study.} \textbf{(a)} I collected ecological trait data and geographical range areas across terrestrial vertebrates (termed `ecological characteristics'). I then used two independent approaches to assess the influence of these characteristics on species responses to land-use and on species climate-change sensitivity. \textbf{(b)} To assess the influence of traits on responses to land use and land-use intensity in each vertebrate class, I combined the ecological characteristics with the PREDICTS database. \textbf{(c)} To estimate species sensitivity to climate change, I used the CENFA framework \citep{Rinnan2019}, which relies on the combination of species’ distributions with climatic variables to estimate sensitivity from properties of the species’ climatic niche space. I then built class-specific models to assess whether the ecological characteristics were associated with  species sensitivity to climate change.}

For diet, I look at `among land-use type' effects, comparing species occurrence probability in disturbed land uses versus that in primary vegetation  (I chose this approach here because visualising `within land-use type' effects for diet is complicated by the fact that there are more than two levels for this categorical trait). (b) For continuous characteristics, I focus on the relationship with occurrence probability, and I investigate how the slope of this relationship is affected by land-use type. }

\caption[Summary of the effects of the ecological characteristics (except for primary diet) on species responses to disturbed land uses (`within land-use type' effects) and on species climate-change sensitivity, for each Class of terrestrial vertebrates.]{\textbf{Summary of the effects of the ecological characteristics (except for primary diet) on (a) species responses to disturbed land uses (`within land-use type' effects) and on (b) species climate-change sensitivity, for each class of terrestrial vertebrates.} The symbol \colorbox{Salmon}{\textcolor{BrickRed}{\textbf{--}}} indicates where a characteristic has a significant negative effect on occurrence probability within a disturbed land-use type, or where the characteristic renders species significantly more sensitive to climate change. A \colorbox{YellowGreen}{\textcolor{ForestGreen}{\textbf{+}}} indicates a significantly  positive effect of a characteristic on occurrence probability in a land-use type, or significantly lower sensitivity to climate change. For the land-use effects, we report `within land-use type effects' here, that is, within a disturbed land use whether there were significant differences in occurrence probability among species with different trait values (see Figure \ref{chap4_fig2}). These effects were derived from the interactive terms of the full, all-predictor models. I report effects detected in any land-use intensity.}

Empty plots are drawn where there were no data for a diet category for a given Class (e.g., amphibian fruit/nectar eaters). Effects could not be estimated for urban reptiles, as well as for urban vertebrate, fruit/nectar and plant/seed eaters for mammals because there were no sampled species. The predictions are rescaled with reference to minimally-used primary vegetation. Primary: primary vegetation; Secondary: secondary vegetation; plantation: plantation forest; agricultural: cropland and pasture.}

The dashed vertical lines mark 10\% explained variance. We individually show all the effects that explain more than 5\% of the overall variation. Effects that individually explain less than 5\% of the overall variation are grouped together as "Other effects".}

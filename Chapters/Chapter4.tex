\caption[Framework of the study]{\textbf{Framework of the study.} \textbf{(a)} I collected ecological trait data and geographical range areas across terrestrial vertebrates (termed `ecological characteristics'). I then used two independent approaches to assess the influence of these characteristics on species responses to land-use and on species climate-change  sensitivity. \textbf{(b)} To assess the influence of traits on responses to land use and land-use intensity in each vertebrate class, I combined the ecological characteristics with the PREDICTS database. \textbf{(c)} To estimate species sensitivity to climate change, I used the CENFA framework \citep{Rinnan2019}, which relies on the combination of species’ distributions with climatic variables to estimate sensitivity from properties of the species’ climatic niche space. I then built class-specific models to assess whether the ecological characteristics were associated with  species sensitivity to climate change.}

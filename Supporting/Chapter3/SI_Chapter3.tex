\section{Trait data \& imputation of missing trait values}

I used the compilation of trait data across terrestrial vertebrates from Chapter 2. I selected seven traits that were available at least for a subset of the species in each class: body mass, trophic level, lifespan, litter/clutch size, diel activity, habitat breadth and use of artificial habitats. These traits related to life-history, habitat specialisation and use of geographical space (for instance, habitat breadth is a significant predictor of geographical range size in all classes, Figure \ref{SI3_F3}). 

%% Habitat breadth predicts range size

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Supporting/Chapter3/Figures/SI_Rangesize_HB}
\caption[Relationship between habitat breadth and geographical range size across species in each class]{\textbf{Relationship between habitat breadth and geographical range size across species in each class.} The derivation of geographical range sizes is described in Chapter 2. The blue lines are the lines of best fit for the regression of geographical range size against habitat breadth in each class, allowing for a quadratic term in the models (range size $\sim$ habitat breadth + habitat breadth$^2$); the shaded areas are the 95\% confidence interval of the lines of best fit.}
\label{SI3_F3}
\end{figure}

Trait-data coverage was highly variable among classes and traits, with important geographical and phylogenetic biases in trait data for reptiles and amphibians (Chapter 2; Figure \ref{SI3_F4}, Figure \ref{SI3_F5}). To obtain complete species-trait datasets, I imputed missing trait values. Further, in order to assess the sensitivity of the models to variation in imputed values, I imputed the missing trait values eight independent times. This allowed me to assess the congruence of the model predictions when using the different imputed trait datasets in the analyses.

\subsection{Choice of imputation technique}
There exist several imputation techniques \citep{Penone2014, Debastiani2021, Johnson2021}, such as K-nearest neighbour \citep{Troyanskaya2001}, multivariate imputation by chained equations \citep{micepackage}, random forest algorithms (implementable in R with the `missforest' function from the `missForest' package; \cite{Stekhoven2012, Stekhoven2016}), and phylogenetic imputations (implementable in R with PhyloPars, \cite{Bruggeman2009}). \citet{Penone2014} assessed the performance of these four techniques and showed that `missforest' and `PhyloPars' performed better when traits were phylogenetically conserved, and when the species phylogenetic position was included as a predictor of missing trait values. `PhyloPars' can only handle continuous data, while `missforest' is compatible with mixed-type (including categorical) data. When no phylogenetic information was included, `mice' was found to be the best method, with fast imputations of mixed-type data \citep{Penone2014}. Therefore, to assess whether `missforest' or `mice' was more appropriate here, I measured the phylogenetic signal in the traits. For continuous traits, I used Pagel’s $\lambda$ \citep{Pagel1999}, and for categorical traits I used Borges’ $\delta$ \citep{Borges2018}. Strong phylogenetic signals would indicate that traits are phylogenetically conserved, and hence `missforest' would be the most suited approach for imputing missing trait values, with the inclusion of species’ phylogenetic positions as a predictor. 

\subsection{Phylogenetic signal in traits}
Across all classes, similar traits were used for calculating functional diversity metrics: body mass, litter/clutch size, lifespan (using different proxies in different vertebrate classes: generation length for birds and mammals, longevity for reptiles, and age at sexual maturity for amphibians), trophic level, diel activity, habitat breadth and use of artificial habitats. In addition, I included some class-specific traits for the imputations, as certain class-specific traits could be useful predictors of other traits (such as body length for instance in amphibians \citep{Santini2018}). Table \ref{SI3_Table2} details the traits that were included for the imputations in each class and the phylogenetic signal for each of these traits. Continuous traits were log-10 transformed before assessing Pagel’s $\lambda$ to improve normality. Pagel’s $\lambda$ was estimated using the `phylosig' function of the `phytools' package \citep{Revell2012}, and Borges’ $\delta$ was assessed using code provided by \citet{Borges2018}, available at : \url{https://github.com/mrborges23/delta_statistic}. To test for the significance of $\delta$, I generated null distributions of $\delta$ for each categorical trait by randomising trait vectors 50 times, and calculating $\delta$ for each randomised vector – following the guidelines proposed by \citet{Borges2018}. I then tested whether the observed medians were greater than the null distributions using one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests.

I used class-specific phylogenies to estimate phylogenetic signal, all downloaded on 13th April 2020. Trees from \citet{Faurby2018, Faurby2020}  were used for mammals (downloaded from \url{https://zenodo.org/record/3690867#.Xyc5wyhKhPZ}). For amphibians, birds and reptiles (squamates only), I downloaded trees from \url{https://data.vertlife.org/}. Trees were from \citet{Jetz2012} for birds, from \citet{Jetz2018} for amphibians and from \citet{Tonini2016} for squamates. For each class, I downloaded a distribution of 1,000 trees, from which I obtained consensus trees to estimate phylogenetic signal (to that end, I used the TreeAnnotator programme of the BEAST software \citep{Bouckaert2014}).

Continuous traits were log-10 transformed to improve normality before estimating Pagel’s $\lambda$ – except for habitat breadth which was square-rooted. A star indicates a significant signal (p-value<0.05 for the log-likelihood ratio test in the case of $\lambda$; and a significant difference from the simulated null distribution of $\delta$ for categorical traits). ‘NA’ indicates traits that were not considered for a given class. All traits showed significant phylogenetic signal, with signals for BM, BL, L, GL, MA and LCS being particularly strong (above 0.8) across the four classes. }

\subsection{Implementation of `missforest' imputations}
As phylogenetic signals were strong in many categorical and continuous traits (Table \ref{SI3_Table2}), I imputed missing trait values using random forest algorithms, as implemented in R with `missforest' from the `missForest' package \citep{Stekhoven2012, Stekhoven2016}. Another advantage of `missforest' was that, being a non-parametric approach, no prior assumption about data distribution was required. The data were therefore not transformed prior to imputations. In addition, \citet{Penone2014} showed that including phylogenetic information did not decrease the accuracy of imputations for traits that were less phylogenetically conserved, such as habitat breadth in this work. 

Phylogenetic relationships were included as additional predictors in the form of phylogenetic eigenvectors \citep{DinizFilho2012}, extracted from the phylogenies using the `PVR' package \citep{Santos2018}. Following \citet{Penone2014}, I included the first ten phylogenetic eigenvectors as additional predictors of missing trait values in each class, enough to minimise imputation error. As not all species were represented in the phylogenies, I also added taxonomic order as a predictor for all species. All traits in Table \ref{SI3_Table2} were included in the imputations. Tuning parameters of `missforest' were set to ten maximum iterations and to one hundred trees grown in each forest. 

\section{Degree of multicollinearity among traits}
Multicollinearity among traits can be problematic when calculating functional diversity indices \citep{Cadotte2011}. After imputing missing trait values and before estimating functional metrics, I assessed whether the degree of multicollinearity among categorical and continuous traits was problematically high. To this end, I used generalised variance inflation factors \citep{Fox1992}. Given a regression model, variance inflation factors quantify the overestimation in the variance of estimated regression coefficients due to multicollinearity among the predictors. A GVIF value of 5 or 10 is commonly used as a threshold to select out collinear predictors \citep{Dormann2013}. I used the `stepwise.vif' function of the `Rnalytica' package (\url{https://github.com/awsm-research/Rnalytica}), with a threshold of 5, to determine the GVIF of each trait. I used the imputed traits from the 8$^{th}$ imputation iteration to assess whether multicollinearity was problematically high. Continuous traits were log-10 transformed (except for habitat breadth which was square-rooted). The degree of multicollinearity among traits was not detected to be problematically high, as all traits had a GVIF value below 2 (Table \ref{SI3_Table3}). As such, all seven traits were included in the calculation of the functional diversity indices.

\section{Functional loss and functional gain}

Across all vertebrates, I estimated functional loss and functional gain using 84 studies for the tropical subset and 39 studies for the temperate subset (51,514 and 30,470 pairwise comparisons between sites respectively, Table \ref{SI3_Table4}). Because of this large number of pairwise comparisons, I did not develop a null modelling approach (if I used 100 randomisations per pair of sites, I would need to compute functional loss and functional gain for more than 8 million pairs, which would be very computationally demanding). I grouped mature, intermediate and young secondary vegetation together in this analysis. I could not estimate the effects in all land uses (for instance, sample sizes for tropical urban sites were too small; Figure \ref{SI3_F1}).

Within classes, I used 18 tropical studies and 1 temperate study for amphibians; 38 tropical studies and 21 temperate studies for birds; 28 tropical studies and 9 temperate studies for mammals; and 11 tropical studies and 7 temperate studies for reptiles. As sample sizes differed among pairs of land uses and land-use intensities (Table \ref{SI3_Table5}), I was not able to estimate all effects, notably for the intensely-used land uses. 

To calculate functional loss and functional gain, the Gower distance matrix (obtained from the global species by trait dataset for the species occurring in PREDICTS) was first subsetted to the species occurring in a given pair of sites. Cailliez corrections were applied when the distance matrix was not Euclidian (Cailliez corrections consist of applying the smallest positive constant to the distances so as to make them Euclidian \citep{Cailliez1983}; `ade4' R package \citep{ade4package}). I then performed a principal coordinates analysis on the (corrected) Gower distance matrix, retaining the first two axes to reduce the computational load in the calculation of convex hulls. Sites that contained fewer than three functionally different species were excluded (the computation of a convex hull requiring more species in the assemblage than PCoA axes). Then I estimated the hypervolume of trait space occupied by each assemblage of a given pair, as well as the volume of the shared trait space (intersection), from which I derived functional loss and functional gain.

\section{Model robustness -- time since land-use conversion}
Time since land-use conversion could have important impacts on assemblage composition and thus, on local functional diversity. I did not investigate these effects because PREDICTS contained data on time since land-use conversion only for about 22\% of the sites, considerably reducing samples sizes. Here, I investigated whether the results are likely robust to the inclusion of time since land-use conversion using the subset of sites for which time since land-use conversion was provided. To this end, I found the best-fitting models explaining FRic and FDis, using backwards stepwise selection, starting with complete models that included the effects of land use, time since land-use conversion, region, land-use intensity (for FRic only) and all two-way interactions among these predictors. 

\begin{itemize}
\item For FRic, the best-fitting model included the main effects of land use and time since land-use conversion, but no interaction between these predictors. The model’s summary (Table \ref{SI3_Table6}) showed that time since conversion had a significant negative effect on FRic, but the relationship between FRic and time since land-use conversion was similar in different land uses (as there were no interactions between land use and time since conversion retained in the best-fitting model, such that the slopes were similar in different land uses, and so the rate at which FRic decreased with time was similar in different land uses). The intercept was only different for urban land uses (significantly lower). Thus, based on this data subset, I expect time since land-use conversion to have a similar effect in different land-use types. 
\vspace{0.3cm}
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[!htbp] \centering 
  \caption[Summary of the model explaining FRic by land use and time since land-use conversion, fitted on the subset of data for which there are information on time since land-use conversion]{Summary of the model explaining FRic by land use and time since land-use conversion, fitted on the subset of data for which there are information on time since land-use conversion.} 
  \label{SI3_Table6} 
\begin{tabular}{@{\extracolsep{5pt}} lccc} 
\\[-1.8ex]\hline 
\hline \\[-1.8ex]

\hline \\[-1.8ex] 
Intercept: Primary vegetation & $1.156$ & $0.073$ & $15.921$ \\ 
Mature secondary vegetation & $0.178$ & $0.093$ & $1.907$ \\ 
Intermediate secondary vegetation & $0.018$ & $0.072$ & $0.249$ \\ 
Young secondary vegetation & $$-$0.078$ & $0.051$ & $$-$1.532$ \\ 
Plantation forest & $$-$0.018$ & $0.082$ & $$-$0.224$ \\ 
Pasture & $$-$0.005$ & $0.093$ & $$-$0.054$ \\ 
Cropland & $0.133$ & $0.152$ & $0.875$ \\ 
Urban & $$-$0.316$ & $0.133$ & $$-$2.368$ \\ 
Time since conversion (log years) & $$-$0.094$ & $0.021$ & $$-$4.566$ \\ 
\hline \\[-1.8ex] 
\end{tabular} 
\end{table} 

I then compared this model’s predictions with a simpler model that did not account for time since land-use conversion (FRic  $\thicksim$ Land use). The predictions (Figure \ref{SI3_F25}) showed that including time since land-use conversion did not bias the results, as I found a similar significant effect with both models in urban land uses, and elsewhere the effects were congruent. Thus, given this data subset, I argue that the results are robust to the inclusion of time since land-use conversion.

\label{SI3_F25}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item For FDis, the best-fitting model included the main effects of land use, time since land-use conversion as well as interactions between land use and time since land-use conversion (I did not consider land-use intensity in the starting model because of sample size issues). Nevertheless, the main effect of time since land-use conversion was not significant (Table \ref{SI3_Table7}), and the relationship between time since land-use conversion and FDis was also not significant in most disturbed land uses (except for plantation forest). Thus, I argue the available data do not allow us to properly investigate the relationship between time since land-use conversion and FDis.

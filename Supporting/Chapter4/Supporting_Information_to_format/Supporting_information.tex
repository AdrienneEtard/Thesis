\section{Compiling diet information}

%% From Rhiannon's thesis
 
\begin{comment}

Data for the amphibian and reptile species which were not provided from pre-existing data sets were gathered using a systematic search carried out in the available literature, focusing on that from peer-reviewed scientific publications where possible. The literature was accessed through the online platforms Google Scholar and Web of Science searching for individual species names and diet-associated words ‘diet*’, ‘food’, ‘food sources’. However, other sources such as field guides, specialised websites and literature such as theses and dissertations were consulted when scientific publications were not available. Data for reptiles and amphibians were gathered in a binary format, focusing on presence-absence data of particular food sources being in a species diet rather than proportions of food sources.Not all diet information was available at the species level therefore extrapolation was used where species data were unavailable. Extrapolation assumed a degree of phylogenetic conservatism within the diet trait. This form of extrapolation and ranking was influenced by that carried out by Kissling at al. (2014) when gathering mammalian trait data. A rank of 0 was assigned to species where no extrapolation was used. A rank of 1.1 was assigned when data was filled from another species within the same genus and there had only been information on one species within that genus available.This assumed that the particular diet of that species was the same as all other species in the same genus. A rank of 1.2 was used when extrapolation was neededwithin a genus and there was diet information on more than one species in the genus. In this instance, all species in the genus with informationhad to have the same diet in order to extrapolate to species for which data was lacking. A rank of 2 was assigned when diet data was filled in from information found that only referred to a particular genus rather than species level information. A rank of 3 was assigned when information was from the family level. Taxonomy for extrapolation purposes was from the Catalogue of Life: 2019 Annual Checklist (Warwick et al., 2019). Throughout data collection a degree of certainty framework was also employed whereby data were assigned a degree of confidence influenced by previous trait dataset work (Gainsbury et al.,2018). Whereas the previous extrapolation framework was employed to include data where information was lacking, the degree of certainty framework was to acknowledge disparity in the quality of research from which the data was drawn. A degree of certainty of 1 was assigned for data of the lowest confidence and a rank of 5 for the highest degree of certainty. A value of 1 was assigned to data such as that which came from family-level extrapolation and observations from morphological estimations. Examples of a degree of certainty of 2 include genus level information and information from species within the same genus which lacks detail (for instance; information extrapolated from species with a degree of certainty of 3 or below). A rank of 3 was assigned when information on the target species possessed very little detail for example,when a species was observed eating a food item once or extrapolation occurred from a species in the same genus as the target species with strong information(degree of certainty of 4 or 5) for the closely related species. A degree of certainty of 4 was assigned in cases where there was some ambiguity in the dietary information or some lack of detail or it was from weaker experimental evidence (e.g., small sample size) for target species. Finally, the highest confidence of 5 was assigned in cases where there was strong experimental evidence, such as data coming from stomach contents or faecal analysis, a large sample size, and detailed results.

%\subsection{Processing diet data from EltonTraits \citep{Wilman2014} for mammals and birds, and from AmphiBIO \citep{Oliveira2017} for amphibians}
For mammals and birds, diet information was obtained from the EltonTraits database \citep{Wilman2014}. Before processing the data, the taxonomy was aligned to that of the trait datasets from \citet{Etard2020} (Chapter 2). Primary diet -- that is, the diet inferred from the combination of food items that represent more than 50\% of species consumption -- was directly available for birds, but not for mammals. For both classes, diet was described as the percent use of different food items (namely: invertebrates, vertebrates -- either ectotherms, endotherms, fish or unknown --, carrion, fruit, nectar, seed or other plant material). In order to have a consistent classification scheme across mammals and birds, we chose not to use the provided primary diet for birds, and instead we applied our own procedure to infer primary diet from recorded food items across birds and mammals. We first grouped the different vertebrate food items together with carrion to create a single `vertebrate' food item category. We then used the percent uses of the food items to infer primary diet, classifying species’ primary diet into the following categories: vertebrate eaters; invertebrate eaters; plant/seed eaters; fruit/nectar eaters; and omnivores [these categories are similar to those employed for birds' primary diet in EltonTraits]. When all food items had a percent use below (or equal to) 50\% percent, species were classified as omnivores. %When a single food item had a percent use strictly above 50\%, species were classified into the corresponding primary diet group.
 For each species, we calculated diet breadth as the number of consumed food items (regardless of the percent use of those items; we kept vertebrate food items grouped together in the calculation of diet breadth, such that we did not count carrion as a separate food item). %Trophic levels for birds were also inferred from the primary diet (with fruit/nectar and plant/seed eaters considered herbivores, invertebrates/vertebrate eaters considered carnivores, and the remaining species considered omnivores).


For amphibians, diet information was partly extracted from the AmphiBIO database \citep{Oliveira2017}, and partly compiled from the literature (see next section). In AmphiBIO, diet information was recorded as the consumption of six food items (leaves, flowers, seeds, fruit, arthropods and vertebrates), but the percent use of these items was not recorded (only whether they were consumed or not). From AmphiBIO, we classified amphibians into the different diet categories, depending on the combinations of consumed food items. 

%\subsection{Diet data complements for amphibians and reptiles}
To increase diet data coverage for amphibians, we compiled data from published papers and from the grey literature, targeting species occurring in the PREDICTS database (which we used for inferring land-use responses). We were able to collect diet information for an additional 108 amphibians from 26 published sources (all found to be invertebrate eaters; see below for the list of sources). For reptiles, there was no readily available diet information (except for trophic level information, see \citet{Etard2020}). Thus, we collected diet data from the literature, again specifically targeting reptiles occurring in the PREDICTS database. From the literature, we added diet information for 239 reptiles. Finally, diet breadth was calculated across amphibians and reptiles from the recorded food items. The compiled diet data are available at:

Continuous traits were log-10 transformed to improve normality before estimating Pagel’s $\lambda$ – except for habitat breadth which was square-rooted. A star indicates a significant signal (P<0.05 for the log-likelihood ratio test in the case of $\lambda$; and a significant difference from the simulated null distribution of $\delta$ for categorical traits). ‘NA’ indicates traits that were not considered for a given class. %All traits showed significant phylogenetic signal, with signals for BM, BL, L, GL, MA and LCS being particularly strong (above 0.8) across the four classes.

\subsection{Implementation of missing value imputations}
We imputed missing trait values using random forest algorithms, as implemented in R with missForest \citep{Stekhoven2012, Stekhoven2016}. Phylogenetic relationships were included as additional predictors in the form of phylogenetic eigenvectors \citep{DinizFilho2012}, extracted from the phylogenies using the PVR package \citep{Santos2018}. We used class-specific phylogenetic trees from \url{https://zenodo.org/record/3690867#.Xyc5wyhKhPZ} for mammals (Phylacine 1.2; Faurby et al. (2018, 2020)); and from \url{https://data.vertlife.org/} for amphibians (Jetz \& Pyron 2018), birds (Jetz et al. 2012) and squamates (Tonini et al. 2016). For each class, we used a consensus tree obtained with the TreeAnnotator programme of the BEAST software (Bouckaert et al. 2014), from an available distribution of 1000 trees. 

Following \citet{Penone2014}, we included the first ten phylogenetic eigenvectors as additional predictors of missing trait values in each class. As not all species were represented in the phylogenies, we also added taxonomic order as a predictor for all species. All traits in Table \ref{SI_4_Table1} were included in the imputations. Habitat \& diet breadth were considered as categorical variables for the imputations (and so, discretised), in order to ensure that only integer estimates were obtained from the imputations for these traits. Tuning parameters of `missforest' were set to ten maximum iterations and to one hundred trees grown in each forest.

\section{Implementing Climate-niche Factor Analysis across terrestrial vertebrates}

\label{SI_4_Figure5}
\end{figure}


\subsection{CENFA estimation and resolution}
We estimated climate-change sensitivity across terrestrial vertebrates with the CENFA framework using three different resolutions for the species distribution files and the climatic variables: 50 km$^2$, 10 km$^2$ and 5 km$^2$. Indeed, the finer the resolution, the better species distribution is likely to be captured, particularly for narrow-ranging species (Figure \ref{SI_4_Figure6}). When working with coarser resolutions, the actual geographical distribution of a narrow-ranging species might be overestimated (Figure \ref{SI_4_Figure6}), such that the climatic niche breadth of the species might also be overestimated, and consequently its climate-change sensitivity might be underestimated. However, finer resolutions are more computationally demanding, which can be limiting when working across several thousand species. 

Thus, we looked for a resolution that provided the best estimations of climate-change sensitivity for the narrow-ranging species while requiring acceptable computational load. With a resolution of 50 km$^2$, climate-change sensitivity tended to be overestimated for a larger number of narrow-ranging species than at 10 km$^2$ (Figure \ref{SI_4_Figure7}); and at 10 km$^2$, climate-change sensitivity tended to be overestimated for a larger number of narrow-ranging species than at 5 km$^2$ (Figure \ref{SI_4_Figure7}). Below 5 km$^2$, we deemed the computational load not acceptable for a global estimation of climate-change sensitivity across terrestrial vertebrates.

Hence, we chose to work with a resolution of 5 km$^2$. At this resolution, there were still some narrow-ranging species for which sensitivity was likely overestimated (Figure \ref{SI_4_Figure7}). To prevent any impact of these species on the analyses, we removed species with the smallest geographical range areas, using a conservative threshold of 100 km$^2$ for geographical range area (Figure \ref{SI_4_Figure7}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figures/ResolutionConcept.png}
\caption[Possible impact of resolution on estimated geographical range area]{\textbf{Possible impact of resolution on estimated geographical range area}. We represent a virtual distribution for a species (orange shape). The species distribution is more accurately captured at finer resolutions (e.g., 5 km$^2$) than at coarser resolutions (e.g., 10 km$^2$ or 50 km$^2$). A possible consequence is that coarser resolutions can tend to disproportionally overestimate the geographical range area of narrow-ranging species, because the aggregation of grid cells where the species is found to be present can artificially augment the amount of occupied area at coarser resolutions, and relatively more so if the species is narrow-ranging.}

Hence, for each trait, the `0' baseline represents the reference level of the trait, and the effects show how any other trait level affects occurrence probability. For diet, we only show effects for mammals and birds because the full models did not include diet for reptiles and amphibians. Effects for urban reptiles could not be estimated are weren't any sampled sites.

\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Figures/MCMCglmm_Land_use_categorical_traits}
\caption[Effects of categorical traits on species probability of occurrence in the different land-use types, estimated from the full (all-predictor) models fitted in each class with a Bayesian approach]{\textbf{Effects of categorical traits on species probability of occurrence in the different land-use types, estimated from the full (all-predictor) models fitted in each class with a Bayesian approach, using the `MCMCglmm' R package \citep{MCMCglmm}.} The estimated effects correspond to those of the interaction terms between land use and each trait (as well as the interaction terms between land-use intensity and each trait). Hence, for each trait, the `0' baseline represents the reference level of the trait, and the effects show how any other trait level affects occurrence probability. For diet, we only show effects for mammals and birds because the full models did not include diet for reptiles and amphibians. Effects for urban reptiles could not be estimated are weren't any sampled sites. Primary: primary vegetation; Secondary: secondary vegetation; plantation: plantation forest; agricultural: cropland and pasture.}

Each column corresponds to a class and each row corresponds to a predictor (BM=body mass; LP=lifespan proxy; LCS=litter/clutch size; RA=geographical range area; DB=diet breadth; HB=habitat breadth). We did not plot the effects for amphibians in urban land uses, and those for mammals in urban land uses (for diet breadth), because error bars were large (and all effects were null). Effects for urban reptiles could not be estimated are weren't any sampled sites. Primary: primary vegetation; Secondary: secondary vegetation; plantation: plantation forest; agricultural: cropland and pasture.}

Overall, the estimates from both sets of models were congruent, except for those estimated for geographical range area (we show the effects for range area separately from the effects of other characteristics). Across all classes, the relationship between sensitivity and geographical range area was reversed between the two sets of models. We found that sensitivity was positively associated with geographical range area when including all species, likely because of the underestimation of climate-change sensitivity for the most narrow-ranging species when working with a resolution of 5 km$^2$ (see Figure \ref{SI_4_Figure7}). The dashed line is the identity line (y=x).}

A \colorbox{YellowGreen}{\textcolor{ForestGreen}{\textbf{+}}} indicates a significantly positive effect of a characteristic on occurrence probability in a land-use type (within any of the land-use intensities), or significantly lower sensitivity to climate change. For the land-use effects, we report `within land-use type effects' here, that is, within a disturbed land use whether there were significant differences in occurrence probability among species with different trait values. These effects were derived from the interactive terms of the full models.}

Empty plots are drawn where there were no data for a diet category in  given class (e.g., amphibian fruit/nectar eaters). Effects could not be estimated for urban reptiles, as well as for urban vertebrate, fruit/nectar and plant/seed eaters for mammals because there were no sampled species.
